Purpose: Crucial for explaining how to use your module. It's the first place users will look for information.
Content: Should include:
Module purpose: What does it do?
Usage examples: How to call the module.
Inputs: Table of all input variables, their types, descriptions, and default values.
Outputs: Table of all output values and their descriptions.
Requirements: Any prerequisites (e.g., provider configuration, IAM permissions).
Authors/License: Attribution and licensing information.
Step-by-Step: Creating a Module
Identify the Infrastructure Component: Decide what logical piece of infrastructure your module will manage (e.g., a single VM, a VPC network, a database instance, a load balancer, or a combination of these).
Create the Module Directory: Create a new directory for your module (e.g., modules/my-gcp-vm).
Define Resources (main.tf):
Start by writing the resource blocks for the infrastructure you want to manage.
For any values that need to be customizable by the user, replace them with var.<placeholder>.
Define Inputs (variables.tf):
For each var.<placeholder> you used in main.tf, declare a corresponding variable block in variables.tf.
Add clear descriptions.
Specify types.
Add default values where it makes sense (e.g., for optional parameters or common configurations).
Define Outputs (outputs.tf):
Identify any information about the created resources that a user might need (e.g., IP addresses, resource IDs, URLs).
Declare output blocks for these values, referencing the attributes of the resources from main.tf.
Specify Versions (versions.tf):
Add the terraform and required_providers blocks to versions.tf to define compatibility.
Document (README.md): Write a comprehensive README.md following the guidelines above.
Test (Optional but Recommended): Create an examples/ subdirectory with a simple main.tf that calls your module. This allows you to test the module in isolation.
